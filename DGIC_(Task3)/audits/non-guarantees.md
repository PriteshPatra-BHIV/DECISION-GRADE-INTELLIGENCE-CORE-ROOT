# Audit Non-Guarantees

## Purpose
This document explicitly defines what the
Decision-Grade Intelligence Core does NOT guarantee.

Absence of guarantees is intentional and required for safety.

---

## Explicit Non-Guarantees

The system does NOT guarantee:

1. Correct decisions  
2. Optimal outcomes  
3. Risk minimization  
4. Policy effectiveness  
5. Prediction accuracy  
6. Conflict resolution  
7. Safety of downstream execution  
8. Absence of uncertainty  
9. Completeness of information  
10. Moral or legal justification

## Responsibility Allocation

All responsibility for:
- Decisions
- Actions
- Enforcement
- Consequences

lies **outside** this system.

This system provides information only.

---

## Status

Non-guarantees explicit.  
Authority avoided.  
Responsibility correctly externalized.
