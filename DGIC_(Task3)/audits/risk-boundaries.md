# Risk Boundaries

## Purpose
This document defines the explicit risk boundaries
within which the Decision-Grade Intelligence Core operates.

Crossing these boundaries constitutes system misuse.

---

## In-Bounds Risks (Accepted)

The system accepts the following risks:

- Partial or incomplete information  
- Conflicting interpretations  
- Increasing uncertainty over time  
- Refusal to provide decisions  
- Inconclusive outputs  

These are **expected behaviors**, not failures.

---

## Out-of-Bounds Risks (Forbidden)

The system must never accept:

- Authority over decisions  
- Action execution capability  
- Policy enforcement power  
- Autonomous reward optimization  
- Silent uncertainty collapse  
- Feedback loops between output and action  

Any occurrence is a **critical violation**.

---

## Boundary Enforcement

Boundaries are enforced through:
- Output contracts
- Refusal mechanisms
- Learning constraints
- Audit visibility

Violations must cause the system to fail closed.

---

## Status

Risk boundaries defined.  
Unsafe regions excluded.  
System safe under pressure.
