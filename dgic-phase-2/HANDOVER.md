# HANDOVER — Phase II Irreversibility Closure

## Overview

Phase II formalizes and enforces epistemic integrity.

This sprint introduced:

- State transition enforcement
- Immutable collapse logging
- Stress validation safeguards
- Anti-fabrication discipline

---

## What Phase II Added

- Finite-state transition enforcement
- Append-only epistemic journal
- Illegal promotion blocking
- Irreversibility guarantees

---

## Architectural Position

This layer sits:

Above Phase I epistemic rules
Below downstream advisory consumers

It prevents epistemic drift.

---

## Modification Warning

Future changes must preserve:

- Transition enforcement
- Collapse logging
- Journal immutability
- Stress integrity discipline

Violations invalidate sovereign compliance.

---

## Closure Statement

The Decision-Grade Intelligence Core
is now hardened against irreversible environments.

Epistemic integrity survives stress.
