# System Guarantees — Phase II

## Purpose

This document extends sovereign guarantees
to irreversible and adversarial environments.

---

## Reinforced Guarantees

1. State Transition Integrity
   - Illegal promotions are programmatically blocked.
   - All transitions are enforceable.

2. Irreversibility Guarantee
   - All collapse events are logged.
   - Prior ambiguity is preserved.
   - Journal is append-only.

3. Anti-Fabrication Guarantee
   - The system never fabricates certainty.
   - Stress does not alter epistemic discipline.

4. Auditability Guarantee
   - Every certainty claim is traceable.
   - Every collapse is reconstructable.

## Non-Guarantees

The system does NOT guarantee:

- Conflict resolution
- Decision optimality
- Elimination of ambiguity
- Predictive correctness

---

## Sovereign Statement

Even in irreversible environments,
the system preserves epistemic integrity.

Authority is never assumed.
Certainty is never fabricated.
