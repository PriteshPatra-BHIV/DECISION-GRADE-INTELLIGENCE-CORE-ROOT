# Epistemic Journal

## Purpose

The Epistemic Journal records all irreversible state transitions,
especially collapse events.

No epistemic transition may occur without journal entry.

---

## What Must Be Logged

Every collapse event must record:

- Previous State
- Target State
- Timestamp
- Evidence Reference
- Justification
- Actor (system / module)
- Transition ID

---

## Collapse Logging Rule

If a transition moves toward greater certainty
(Inferred → Known or Ambiguous → Known),
it must be logged as a Collapse Event.

Collapse without logging is invalid.

---

## Irreversibility Principle

Once collapse occurs:

- The prior state must remain auditable.
- Historical ambiguity must not be erased.
- Journal entries must be immutable.

No retroactive modification is allowed.

---

## Journal Integrity Requirements

The journal must:

- Be append-only
- Preserve chronological order
- Prevent deletion of prior entries
- Support external audit

---

## Violation Conditions

System integrity fails if:

- Collapse occurs without entry
- Journal entries are modified
- Prior ambiguity is deleted
- Transition reason is missing

---

## Structural Insight

Irreversibility is not about preventing change.
It is about preserving history.

The system must remember uncertainty,
even after resolution.
