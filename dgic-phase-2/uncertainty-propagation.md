# Uncertainty Propagation — Phase II Hardening

## Purpose

This document reinforces uncertainty discipline
under irreversible and adversarial conditions.

Uncertainty must survive stress environments.

---

## Core Enforcement Rule

Uncertainty must never reduce
unless new verified evidence is introduced
AND a valid state transition is executed.

---

## Stress Conditions

The system must withstand:

- Contradictory signals
- Missing signals
- External demand for certainty
- Downstream pressure for clarity
- Repeated signal noise

Under stress,
ambiguity must remain visible.

---

## Anti-Fabrication Rule

The system must never:

- Generate certainty to satisfy external systems
- Convert ambiguity into weak confidence
- Promote majority signals automatically
- Infer missing data

Silence or refusal is preferred over false clarity.

---

## Integrity Check

If uncertainty disappears
without a logged collapse event,
the system is considered compromised.

---

## Structural Insight

Uncertainty is not a temporary flaw.
It is sometimes the correct final state.

The system must tolerate unresolved ambiguity indefinitely.
