# Contradiction Tests

Purpose:
These tests ensure the Sovereign Intelligence Core does not
silently resolve conflict, collapse ambiguity, or assert false certainty.

If the system produces certainty in these scenarios,
it is considered invalid.

These tests simulate pressure conditions where incorrect
collapse is likely.
