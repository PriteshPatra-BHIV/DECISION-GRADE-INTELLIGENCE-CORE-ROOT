# Sovereign Intelligence Core — Epistemic Closure

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Sealed  
**Track:** Decision-Grade Intelligence Core

---

## Purpose

This repository contains the complete epistemic layer for a sovereign intelligence system.

The system is designed to:
- Produce structured truth with provenance
- Preserve uncertainty explicitly
- Distinguish Known, Inferred, Ambiguous, and Unknown states
- Align classical reasoning with quantum measurement principles
- Never collapse ambiguity without justification

---

## Core Principles

1. **Incorrect certainty is worse than no answer**
2. **Explicit non-knowledge is a feature**
3. **Alignment with measurement, collapse, and irreversibility is mandatory**
4. **The system informs but never decides**

---

## Documentation Structure

### Epistemic Foundation
- [epistemic-boundaries.md](epistemic-boundaries.md) - Defines what the system can and cannot assert
- [intelligence-semantics.md](intelligence-semantics.md) - Output structure and semantic rules
- [signal-taxonomy.md](signal-taxonomy.md) - Signal classification and knowledge state mapping

### Uncertainty Management
- [uncertainty-propagation.md](uncertainty-propagation.md) - How uncertainty flows through the system
- [collapse-rules.md](collapse-rules.md) - When epistemic collapse is permitted
- [non-knowledge-contract.md](non-knowledge-contract.md) - How absence of knowledge is handled

### System Guarantees
- [system-guarantees.md](system-guarantees.md) - Formal guarantees and non-guarantees
- [final-intelligence-audit.md](final-intelligence-audit.md) - Verification of epistemic integrity

### Implementation
- [implementation-interfaces.md](implementation-interfaces.md) - Data structures and API contracts
- [contradiction-tests/](contradiction-tests/) - Test scenarios for epistemic discipline

### Quantum Foundations
- [quantum-notes-day1.md](quantum-notes-day1.md) - Measurement and information limits
- [quantum-notes-day2.md](quantum-notes-day2.md) - Mixed states and irreversibility
- [quantum-synthesis.md](quantum-synthesis.md) - How quantum principles prevent false certainty

### Integration

## Compliance

This system:
- Contains no ML models or probabilistic hacks
- Never collapses uncertainty implicitly
- Never hides ambiguity behind scores
- Never assumes future enforcement behavior
- Never acts as authority

---

## Usage Warning

This intelligence core is sealed at the epistemic level.

Any modification that introduces:
- Silent certainty
- Implicit collapse
- Authority behavior
- Confidence scoring

...invalidates all system guarantees.
