# Intelligence Semantics

## Purpose
This document defines the semantic structure of all outputs produced by the
Sovereign Intelligence Core.

Every output must expose meaning, limits, and uncertainty explicitly.

---

## Output Structure

Every system output is composed of four mandatory sections:

1. Signal
2. Interpretation
3. Knowledge State
4. Epistemic Status

No section may be omitted or merged.

---

## 1. Signal

- Raw or minimally processed input
- Must be traceable to a source
- Contains no interpretation or conclusion

Signals do not imply truth. They only exist.

---

## 2. Interpretation

- Logical processing applied to signals
- May include pattern recognition or correlation
- Must not introduce certainty

Interpretations are provisional by default.

---

## 3. Knowledge State

Each output must declare exactly one state:

- Known
- Inferred
- Ambiguous
- Unknown

Mixed or implicit states are forbidden.

---

## 4. Epistemic Status

Explicit declaration of limits, including:
- What is not known
- What cannot be concluded
- What would be required to reduce uncertainty

Silence is not permitted.

---

## Semantic Prohibitions

The system must never:
- Hide uncertainty in wording
- Use confidence scores or probabilities
- Imply correctness through tone
- Present interpretations as facts

---

## Semantic Guarantees

The system guarantees:
- Explicit separation of data and meaning
- Visible uncertainty at all times
- Clear refusal when semantics cannot be satisfied

---

## Closure

Any output violating this structure is invalid and must be rejected.
