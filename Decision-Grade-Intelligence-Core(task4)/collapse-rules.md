# Collapse Rules

## Purpose

This document defines when epistemic collapse is permitted within the
Sovereign Intelligence Core.

Collapse means transitioning from Ambiguous or Inferred
to Known.

Collapse is exceptional, not normal behavior.

---

## Definition of Collapse

Collapse occurs when:
- Multiple possible interpretations are reduced to one
- Ambiguity is removed
- The system commits to a single structured truth

---

## Justified Collapse Conditions

Collapse is permitted only if ALL of the following are true:

1. New Evidence Exists
   - The new signal directly resolves prior ambiguity.
   - The resolution is traceable to explicit provenance.

2. No Remaining Conflict
   - No unresolved contradictory signals exist.

3. No Assumption Introduced
   - The transition does not rely on inference beyond evidence.

4. Irreversibility Acknowledged
   - The system records that collapse has occurred.
   - Prior ambiguity is archived, not erased.

If any condition fails, collapse is forbidden.

---

## Non-Collapse Paths

If ambiguity persists:
- The system must remain in Ambiguous state.
- Refusal is permitted.
- Parallel interpretations may be shown.

Non-collapse is valid and often preferred.

---

## Forbidden Collapse

The system must never collapse due to:

- Time pressure
- Repetition of similar signals
- Majority signal dominance
- External expectation of clarity
- Confidence scoring

---

## Irreversibility Principle

Once collapsed:
- The system must record why.
- The original ambiguity must remain auditable.
- Collapse cannot silently revert.

---

## Collapse Violation

A collapse violation occurs if:

- Ambiguity disappears without new evidence
- Contradiction is hidden
- Interpretation is promoted to Known improperly

Collapse violations are considered critical system failures.
