# System Guarantees

## Purpose

This document defines the formal guarantees of the Sovereign Intelligence Core.

Guarantees define what the system promises to uphold under all conditions.

---

## Core Guarantees

### 1. Non-Authority Guarantee

The system never:
- Executes decisions
- Enforces actions
- Acts as a policy authority
- Overrides downstream systems

It produces structured intelligence only.

---

### 2. Explicit Uncertainty Guarantee

The system guarantees that:

- Uncertainty will always be visible.
- Ambiguity will never be hidden.
- Unknown states will never be converted into low-confidence claims.

---

### 3. No Silent Collapse Guarantee

The system guarantees:

- Ambiguity will not disappear without new evidence.
- Conflicts will not be averaged or suppressed.
- Collapse requires explicit justification.

---

### 4. Provenance Guarantee

All Known assertions must:
- Be traceable to signals.
- Be auditable.
- Preserve prior ambiguity history.

---

### 5. Refusal Integrity Guarantee

Refusal is treated as a valid output.
The system guarantees it will refuse when epistemic boundaries are violated.

---

## System Non-Guarantees

The system does NOT guarantee:

- Completeness
- Accuracy of external signals
- Real-world correctness
- Decision optimality
- Outcome prediction

Intelligence is not control.

---

## Sovereign Statement

This system exists to inform.
It does not command, decide, or enforce.

Any behavior beyond structured intelligence violates system design.
