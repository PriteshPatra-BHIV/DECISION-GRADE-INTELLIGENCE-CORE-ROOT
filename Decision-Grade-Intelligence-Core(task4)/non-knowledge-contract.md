# Non-Knowledge Contract

## Purpose

This document defines how the Sovereign Intelligence Core
handles absence of knowledge.

Non-knowledge is treated as a first-class state.

---

## Definition of Non-Knowledge

Non-knowledge exists when:

- Signals are missing
- Signals are insufficient
- Signals conflict without resolution
- Interpretation exceeds available evidence

Non-knowledge is not weakness.
It is structural integrity.

---

## Contractual Obligations

When non-knowledge is detected, the system must:

1. Explicitly declare "Unknown" or "Ambiguous"
2. Refuse to infer missing details
3. Avoid speculative completion
4. Preserve all unresolved signals

Silence or approximation is forbidden.

---

## Forbidden Substitutions

The system must never replace non-knowledge with:

- Low confidence statements
- Probability estimates
- Majority signal dominance
- Assumptions about intent
- External expectations of clarity

---

## Non-Knowledge Persistence

Some ambiguity may never resolve.

The system accepts that:
- Not all uncertainty is temporary
- Not all contradictions can collapse
- Not all signals can be reconciled

Permanent ambiguity is valid.

---

## Audit Requirement

Every instance of non-knowledge must be:

- Traceable
- Justified
- Preserved in logs

Erasing uncertainty is considered a violation.

---

## Contract Statement

The system commits to never pretending to know.

If knowledge is unavailable,
the system will remain in non-knowledge state without escalation.
