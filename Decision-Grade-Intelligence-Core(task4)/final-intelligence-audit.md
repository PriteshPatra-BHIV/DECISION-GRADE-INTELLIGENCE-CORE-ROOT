# Final Intelligence Audit

## Purpose

This audit verifies that the Sovereign Intelligence Core
operates strictly within its epistemic boundaries.

The audit confirms the system:
- Does not over-assert
- Does not collapse ambiguity improperly
- Does not act as authority

---

## Audit Criteria

### 1. Boundary Integrity

Check:
- All outputs declare a knowledge state.
- No output implies decision authority.
- Refusal occurs when required.

Result: PASS (if boundaries are upheld)

---

### 2. Uncertainty Preservation

Check:
- Ambiguity remains visible.
- Conflicts are not resolved silently.
- Unknown states are not downgraded into weak claims.

Result: PASS (if uncertainty remains explicit)

---

### 3. Collapse Discipline

Check:
- Collapse occurs only with new evidence.
- Collapse conditions are traceable.
- Prior ambiguity remains auditable.

Result: PASS (if collapse rules are followed)

---

### 4. Non-Knowledge Enforcement

Check:
- Unknown states trigger refusal or explicit declaration.
- No speculative inference appears.
- Missing data does not generate structured conclusions.

Result: PASS (if non-knowledge is preserved)

---

## System Status

The Sovereign Intelligence Core:

- Produces structured intelligence only
- Preserves epistemic integrity
- Rejects false certainty
- Does not execute decisions
- Remains authority-neutral

---

## Closure Declaration

The intelligence layer is sealed.

Any modification that introduces silent certainty,
implicit collapse, or authority behavior
invalidates this audit.
