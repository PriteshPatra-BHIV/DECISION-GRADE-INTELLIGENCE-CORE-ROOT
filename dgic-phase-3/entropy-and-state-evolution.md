# Entropy and State Evolution

## Purpose

This document explains how entropy and irreversibility
inform deterministic state evolution in the
Decision-Grade Intelligence Core — Phase 3.

This is conceptual grounding for runtime enforcement.

## Entropy in Physics

In thermodynamics and quantum theory:

- Entropy measures information dispersion.
- Irreversible processes increase entropy.
- Past microstates cannot be perfectly reconstructed.

Irreversibility is fundamental.

---

## System Analogy

In the epistemic state machine:

- Each transition adds historical information.
- Collapse events reduce ambiguity but increase historical record.
- Journal growth is monotonic.

The system does not lose entropy.
It accumulates epistemic history.

---

## Irreversible Evolution

Each state transition:

- Appends to journal
- Extends hash chain
- Increases historical depth

Past states cannot be deleted
without breaking integrity.

This creates computational irreversibility.

---

## No Entropy Reduction via Mutation

If someone attempts to:

- Remove journal entries
- Modify prior transitions
- Rewrite ambiguity history

Hash chain fails.

This prevents entropy reduction via mutation.

---

## Deterministic Entropy

Unlike physical systems:

- State transitions are deterministic.
- Replay produces identical history.

Entropy accumulation is controlled,
but irreversibility is enforced.

---

## Epistemic Insight

Collapse reduces ambiguity at runtime,
but journal preserves pre-collapse uncertainty.

Thus:

Operational certainty increases,
while historical entropy never decreases.

---

## Sealing Principle

Irreversibility + deterministic replay
creates a sealed epistemic evolution model.

State evolution is:

- Forward-only
- Auditable
- Non-reversible
- Mutation-resistant
