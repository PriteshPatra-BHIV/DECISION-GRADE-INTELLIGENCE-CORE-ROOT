# Collapse as Measurement — System Analogy

## Purpose

This document explains how epistemic collapse
in the Deterministic Irreversibility Engine
maps to quantum measurement principles.

This is an analogy for system design discipline,
not a physics implementation.

## Quantum Measurement Principle

In quantum theory:

- A system may exist in superposition.
- Measurement produces a definite outcome.
- Measurement is irreversible.
- The pre-measurement state cannot be reconstructed.

Measurement creates information by interaction.

---

## System Analogy

In the Decision-Grade Intelligence Core:

Ambiguous state = epistemic superposition  
Known state = post-measurement outcome  

Collapse from Ambiguous → Known is equivalent to measurement.

---

## Irreversibility Mapping

Quantum:
- Collapse cannot be undone.
- State history cannot be recovered.

System:
- Collapse events are logged.
- Previous ambiguity is archived.
- Journal is append-only.
- Hash chain prevents mutation.

Collapse is irreversible but auditable.

---

## Evidence as Interaction

In physics:
Measurement requires interaction.

In system design:
Collapse requires new verified evidence.

Without evidence, collapse is forbidden.

---

## No Silent Collapse

Quantum collapse requires interaction.

System collapse requires:

- Evidence flag
- Justified collapse flag
- Valid transition
- Journal logging
- Hash chaining

Any collapse without these is invalid.

---

## Deterministic Interpretation

Unlike quantum systems,
this state machine is deterministic.

Given identical input sequence,
replay must produce identical outcome.

Determinism ensures auditability.

---

## Design Insight

Measurement produces knowledge but destroys prior ambiguity.

The system preserves prior ambiguity
in journal history to prevent epistemic erasure.

This ensures:

- Irreversibility
- Auditability
- Non-authority integrity
