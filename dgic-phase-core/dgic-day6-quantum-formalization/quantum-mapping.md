# Quantum Mapping — Conceptual Alignment

## Purpose

Map quantum measurement concepts to classical
intelligence system design.

---

## Superposition → Ambiguity

Quantum:
Multiple states simultaneously possible.

System:
Ambiguous state represents multiple valid interpretations.

---

## Measurement → Collapse

Quantum:
Measurement reduces superposition irreversibly.

System:
Evidence-bound collapse reduces ambiguity to Known.

Irreversible and logged.

---

## Density Operator → Probability Vector

Quantum:
Mixed states represented by density matrix.

System:
Uncertainty represented by normalized probability vector.

---

## Entropy → Uncertainty Measure

Quantum:
Von Neumann entropy measures uncertainty.

System:
Shannon-style entropy measures epistemic spread.

Higher entropy = more uncertainty.
Lower entropy = stronger certainty.

---

## Principle

Knowing more does not mean acting.
Collapse requires evidence, not preference.
