# Entropy Boundary — Uncertainty Integrity

## Purpose

Define measurable uncertainty limits.

The system must prevent:

- False information gain
- Artificial certainty injection
- Confidence inflation

---

## Entropy Definition

Entropy H = - Σ p_i log2(p_i)

Where p_i = probability of each epistemic state.

---

## Entropy Properties

- Maximum entropy when states equally distributed
- Zero entropy when Known = 1.0
- Entropy cannot decrease without new evidence

---

## False Certainty Rule

Entropy reduction must require:

- Evidence
- Logged collapse
- State transition validation

If entropy decreases without evidence → violation.

---

## Boundary Guarantee

Uncertainty cannot shrink without justification.
