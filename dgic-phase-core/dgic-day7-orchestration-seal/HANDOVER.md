# HANDOVER — Decision-Grade Intelligence Core

## System Overview

This Intelligence Core provides:

- Structured epistemic state representation
- Explicit uncertainty preservation
- Deterministic irreversibility
- Entropy-based discipline
- Temporal and causal integrity

---

## Architecture Layers

1. State Machine Hardening
2. Collapse & Irreversibility Encoding
3. Temporal & Causality Discipline
4. Quantum-Aligned Formalization
5. Orchestration-Safe Invariant Sealing

---

## Operational Guarantees

- Deterministic replay
- Mutation detection
- Evidence-bound collapse
- No authority over decisions

---

## Intended Use

To sit beneath:

- Risk engines
- Advisory layers
- Orchestration frameworks

---

## Final Statement

This system informs decisions.
It does not execute them.
It preserves truth boundaries.
