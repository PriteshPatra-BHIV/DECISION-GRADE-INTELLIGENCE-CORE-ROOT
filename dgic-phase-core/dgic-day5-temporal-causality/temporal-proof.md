# Temporal & Causality Proof — Day 5 Seal

## Purpose

This document certifies that the Intelligence Core
enforces forward-only time, prevents retroactive mutation,
and preserves causal integrity under asynchronous inputs.

---

## Forward-Only Temporal Enforcement

Verified:

- Pre-Observation → Observed → Collapsed → Archived
- No backward transitions allowed
- Archived cannot re-enter active lifecycle
- State skipping is blocked

Status: VERIFIED

---

## No Retroactive Mutation

Verified:

- Prior temporal states cannot be modified
- Collapse timestamps cannot be rewritten
- Ledger ordering cannot be altered
- Hash-chain integrity detects corruption

Status: VERIFIED

---

## Out-of-Order Signal Handling

Verified:

- Late-arriving signals are appended
- External timestamps do not reorder ledger
- Historical collapse remains intact
- New signals create forward ambiguity only

Status: VERIFIED

---

## Causality Protection

Verified:

- Future signals cannot influence past states
- Collapse must be based on present evidence
- Downstream systems cannot rewrite history

Status: VERIFIED

---

## Replay Consistency

Temporal transitions remain:

- Deterministic
- Replay-consistent
- Mutation-detectable

No temporal divergence observed under stress testing.

---

## Temporal Integrity Guarantee

The system guarantees:

- Time flows forward only
- History is immutable
- Certainty cannot appear retroactively
- Ambiguity cannot be erased silently
- Causal ordering is preserved

---

## Seal Statement

Day 5 establishes structural temporal discipline.

The Intelligence Core is now:

- Temporally coherent
- Causally consistent
- Replay-verifiable
- Resistant to retroactive mutation

Temporal layer sealed.`
